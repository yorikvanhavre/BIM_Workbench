# BIM workbench for FreeCAD

**Warning**: This is highly experimental. Although it is safe to use, it won't break anything, it is meant to be experimental, and not a production environment (yet). You are more than welcome to try this, and help us to build a better BIM workflow, but some features might change or disappear without notice over time.

This is a meta workbench, it doesn't offer specific tools, but rather gathers, under one same workbench, the tools from these other workbenches:

* [Draft](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Draft_Module): 2D drafting tools and general utilities
* [Arch](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Arch_Module): General tools for building construction elements (Walls, columns, etc)
* [Reinforcement](https://github.com/amrit3701/FreeCAD-Reinforcement): Extra tools for reinforcement bars
* [Flamingo](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Flamingo_Workbench): Tools for building metallic structures
* [Bolts](https://github.com/jreinhardt/BOLTS): Additional tools for metallic pieces, fasteners and profiles
* [DXF library](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Draft_DXF): DXF export libraries
* [Frame](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Arch_Frame): Misc tools to build complex frames from sketches
* [Fasteners](https://github.com/shaise/FreeCAD_FastenersWB): Parametric screws, nuts and bolts
* [WebTools](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/WebTools_Workbench): Misc utilities to connect to web services
* A couple of useful macros...

The BIM workbench contains a large number of tools, therefore it is convenient to use it on a large screen, to avoid eating up a lot of precious screen space.

### Installing

Starting from FreeCAD v 0.17, just locate and install the BIM workbench under menu Tools -> Addons manager
